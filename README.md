# Studying concurrency with go

The main idea is to learn go parallel programing by creating examples of the most common parallel programming problems.
All the examples must follow the effective Go guide in order to achieve clear, idiomatic Go code. 

## Benchmark used

- Calculate pi numbers by checking if they fall or not inside a circle.
- Time taken to complete sorting an array of N numbers
